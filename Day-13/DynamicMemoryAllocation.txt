Static Memory Allocation : memory is allocated in stack area.
                           memory is decided at compile-time.

Dynamic Memory Allocation : memory is allocated in heap area.
                           memory is decided at run-time.

malloc():
---------

The name "malloc" stands for memory allocation.

The malloc() function reserves a block of memory of the specified number of bytes.
 And, it returns a pointer of void which can be casted into pointers of any form.


If the size of memory is 'n', and trying to store 'n+1' data , it will return null pointer.

malloc() returns void pointer.

syntax:
------

ptr = (int*)malloc(n*sizeOf(int));


C free()
--------

Dynamically allocated memory created with either calloc() or malloc() doesn't get freed on their own.
 You must explicitly use free() to release the space.
